# 🔐 AI-Powered Identity Verification Using UID (Aadhaar)

This project verifies identity using an Aadhaar card (UID) by applying AI + OCR. It detects the Aadhaar card from an uploaded image, extracts the UID and basic details, validates the UID, checks for fraud or tampering, and masks sensitive information for privacy.

🚀 Features

-> Detect Aadhaar card from image using AI

-> Extract UID, Name, DOB, Gender using OCR

-> Validate UID using checksum and pattern matching

-> Identify fake / tampered Aadhaar cards

-> Mask UID as XXXX-XXXX-1234 for privacy

-> Works fully offline and secure
